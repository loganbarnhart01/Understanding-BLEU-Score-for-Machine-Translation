# Understanding-BLEU-Score-for-Machine-Translation

To better understand the BLEU scoring system and baseline measurements for state of the art machine-translation models, I 
decided to analyze the original publication. 
I've primarily been focused on datasets and model architectures in the past, and in doing so have missed the importance for having
a reliable baseline to measure model accuracy.

I focused on the math behind the evaluation technique and implemented it myself to solidify my understanding.
